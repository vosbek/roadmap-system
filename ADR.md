    subgraph Target ["Target Systems"]
        snowflake[(Snowflake DB)]
    end

    client -->|Upload| api
    api -->|Store| s3_raw
    s3_raw -->|Trigger| step
    step -->|Process| lambda1
    lambda1 -->|Store| s3_processed
    s3_processed -->|Transform| lambda2

- Pay-per-use pricing
- Minimal maintenance

**Cons**
- 15-minute execution limit
- Cold start latency
- Complex orchestration
- Limited processing power

#### Option 2: Container-Based Architecture (Selected)
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Client ["Client Environment"]
        client[Customer System]
    end

    subgraph AWS Cloud ["AWS Cloud"]
        subgraph Ingestion ["Data Ingestion"]
            sftp[AWS Transfer Family]
            s3_raw[(S3 Raw Bucket)]
        end

        subgraph Container Layer ["Container Processing"]
            eventbridge[EventBridge]
            subgraph ECS Cluster ["ECS Cluster"]
                container1[PDF Extraction Container]
                container2[Transform Container]
            end
            ecr[(ECR Registry)]
        end

        subgraph Storage ["Storage"]
            s3_processed[(S3 Processed Bucket)]
        end

        subgraph Monitoring ["Monitoring"]
            cloudwatch[CloudWatch]
            sns[SNS]
        end
    end

    subgraph Target ["Target Systems"]
        snowflake[(Snowflake DB)]
        ticket[Ticket System]
    end

    client -->|Upload| sftp
    sftp -->|Store| s3_raw
    s3_raw -->|Trigger| eventbridge
    eventbridge -->|Process| container1
    container1 -->|Store| s3_processed
    s3_processed -->|Transform| container2
    container2 -->|Load| snowflake
    container1 -.->|Logs| cloudwatch
    container2 -.->|Alerts| sns
    sns -.->|Create| ticket
```

**Estimated Costs (Monthly)**
- AWS Transfer Family: $216
- ECS Cluster: $150
- S3 Storage: $40
- CloudWatch: $50
- Other Services: $76-426
- Total: $532-882

### Decision
We have chosen Option 2: Container-Based Architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Processing Requirements**
   - No time limitations on processing
   - Better resource control
   - Predictable performance
   - Simpler orchestration

2. **Security & Compliance**
   - Managed SFTP service with authentication
   - Network isolation capabilities
   - Audit logging
   - Compliance certifications

3. **Operational Benefits**
   - Familiar container technology
   - Standard CI/CD practices
   - Better debugging capabilities
   - Easier local development

4. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling capabilities
   - Resource optimization
   - Predictable performance

### Consequences

#### Positive
1. Reliable and secure file transfer through AWS Transfer Family
2. Scalable processing using container infrastructure
3. Better resource utilization and control
4. Comprehensive monitoring and error handling
5. Clear separation of concerns
6. Simplified maintenance and updates

#### Negative
1. Higher base cost ($532-882/month vs $160-210/month)
2. Container management overhead
3. More complex deployment process
4. Additional operational responsibilities

### Risk Analysis

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Cost escalation | High | Implement auto-scaling policies, S3 lifecycle management |
| Container failures | Medium | Implement health checks, auto-recovery |
| Processing delays | Medium | Monitor performance metrics, optimize container resources |
| Data security | High | Encrypt data at rest and in transit, implement access controls |

### Cost Optimization Strategies
1. Use Savings Plans for ECS
2. Implement S3 lifecycle policies
3. Optimize container resources
4. Monitor and adjust capacity
5. Consider spot instances for non-critical processing

### Success Metrics
1. Processing time per invoice
2. Error rate
3. System availability
4. Cost per invoice processed
5. Data accuracy rate

### Review Period
- Implementation review: 2 weeks after deployment
- Performance review: 1 month after deployment
- Cost review: 3 months after deployment
